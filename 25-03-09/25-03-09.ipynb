    "\n",
    "- _But since the bar crawl hasn’t started yet and you’re still lucid, you realize it might be awkward if you all return to the same bar too soon. So you decide to figure out how how long it would typically take for this to happen._\n",
    "\n",
    "_So, our question is: Assuming it’s your first time returning to a bar you’ve already been to (i.e., it’s your first “repeat” bar), on average, how many hours will have passed between your first arrival and your second?_"
