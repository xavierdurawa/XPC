    "\n",
    "_Given that these queued passengers did such a poor job of getting into the correct order the first time, you don’t trust them them to get it right this time. So instead you have each of them display their ticket while you move them around. You can move people by selecting two people and swapping their locations.  This is the only movement operation you’re allowed.  If we assume there are 10 people in line and their order is completely random, how many swaps will it take to get them ordered correctly? How about for N people?_"

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a some of the work we did in [Part 1](https://xpuzzlecorner.substack.com/p/misplaced-priorities) to help us solve this problem. We know that the only people who need to be swapped are the ones who are out of order. Everyone that is out of order we can treat as a groups and we know this group is a derangement of k elements (where k is the size of the group). We also already know to compute the probability of there being k people in the incorrect spot so that will help us as well. What we're left with is trying to figure out how many swaps will be required to re-arrange the derangement subset of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we do that? Let's first examine the structure of a derangement (or really any permuation at all). Recall that every permutation can be [written as a product of disjoint cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#:~:text=line%20notation%2C%20etc.\\).-,A%20permutation,is%20called%20a%20k%2Dcycle.%20\\(See%20%C2%A7%C2%A0Cycle%20notation%20below.\\),-A%20fixed%20point). For example, the permutation (12)(34) on 4 elements is composed of two cyles each of size 2. The permutation (1234) is a single cycle of size 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any derangement must be composed of cycles with length greater than 1. This is because if a cycle has length 1, then that element is in the correct spot. \n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we correct each of these cycles. Let's consider a cycle of length 2. We can correct this cycle with a single swap. For example, the cycle (12) can be corrected by swapping 1 and 2. How about a cycle with length 3? We can correct this cycle with 2 swaps. For example, the cycle (123) can be corrected by swapping 1 and 2 and then swapping 1 and 3. So it appears that we can correct a cycle of length k with k-1 swaps. To verify this, we consider how the cycle could have been made (since a swap operation is completely reversable). if we consider a element that's mapped to itself as a cycle of length 1, then every swap operation you do will increase the length of a cycle by 1. And since you can't arbitrarily merge 2 cycles with length >2 into a single cycle, you can't reduce the length of a cycle by more than 1. So we can correct a cycle of length k with k-1 swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "So no we just need to compute the probability distribution of various cycle lengths associated with a derangement. We can do this by considering the number of ways to partition a set of size k into cycles of length greater than 1."

For a cycle of length 2, we need to ensure that the element is not mapped to itself. There are $n-1$ options for where the first element can be mapped and then element 2 needs to map back to element 1. So the probability is $\\frac{n-1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n}$.
